1. Describe the two ways to bind Data in Vue?

Two ways that we can bind data in vue are one-way data binding and two-way data binding. One way data binding allows to bind data from the instance to the DOM. Two-way data allows you to bind data to form input elements.

2. The `SPA` acronym stands for what?

  The SPA acronym stands for Single Page Application.

  Some of the advantages of using SPA is that it helps with a faster and smoother User experience, code reusability, and can improve security.

4. What does the `onMounted` method in Vue do?

  The onMounted method in vue performs actions when a component is mounted, which in this case it means when it is inserted into the DOM, it will become active.

5. What is the `v-model` attribute in Vue for, and when might you use it?

  Some of the Vue attributes used to conditionally render elements are v-if and v-for. V-for is used mainly on more of lists and v-if is more if it is true then it will only be rendered if it is.

8. What is the purpose of the `key` attribute when using `v-for` on an element?

  The purpose of the key attribute when using v-for elements is that it gives each rendered element a unique id within that list

9. What is the `<slot>` element and what is it used for?
