# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > The difference between synchronous and asynchronous is that synchronous code executes the code one after another while in the other hand, asynchornous does not, it allows code to be initiated without waiting for their completion. 

02. What is an event listener?

  > A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, but its main purpose is to be executed at a later time. Higher order function is one that takes one or more function as arguments and returns them as a result.

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > The API acronym stands for Application Program Interface.

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > What you must do in order to await a promise inside the function you will to declare and define am async function.

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > The purpose of encapsulation in programming is it bundles data and methods together in a controlled manner, which helps protect data, abstraction, modularity, and organization of code.

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > The HTTP response code for a successful request is 200

11. What is a 400 error?
